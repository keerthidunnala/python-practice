#Our task is to help Ross lean the tables.
#Let us take the table value to be 2 and the ending count value ro be 10
#First print the 2 table. After printing, ask the user whether he wants to continue, if yes then print the next table and so on until the user says no.
#Sample Input:
#table = 2
 
#end = 10
#Expected Output:
#2 X 1 = 2
#2 X 2 = 4
#2 X 3 = 6
#2 X 4 = 8
#2 X 5 = 10
#2 X 6 = 12
#2 X 7 = 14
#2 X 8 = 16
#2 X 9 = 18
#2 X 10 = 20
#Do you want to continue printing the table, press 1 or 0 to Exit: 1 3 X 1 = 3
#3 X 2 = 6
#3 X 3 = 9
#3 X 4 = 12
#3 X 5 = 15
#3 X 6 = 18
#3 X 7 = 21
#3 X 8 = 24
#3 X 9 = 27
#3 X 10 = 30
#Do you want to continue printing the table, press 1 or 0 to Exit:
